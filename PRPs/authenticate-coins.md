# Authentication Commands Implementation (cmd_auth)

## Module Purpose
This module implements the core authentication and proof-of-ownership commands for the RAIDA network. It provides coin verification, authenticity checking, ownership transfer operations, and supports both individual coin operations and efficient batch operations using cryptographic sum verification. The module handles multi-shard operations supporting legacy CloudCoin and SuperCoin systems alongside the current RAIDA system.

## Core Functionality

### 1. Detect Command (`cmd_detect`)
**Parameters:**
- Connection info structure containing request body

**Returns:** None (sets connection status and output)

**Purpose:** Verifies the authenticity of a list of coins by comparing their authentication numbers against stored values.

**Process:**
1. **Request Validation:**
   - Validates minimum request size (39 bytes: 18-byte header + 21 bytes per coin)
   - Calculates number of coins from body size (coin_length / 21)
   - Each coin requires: 1 byte denomination + 4 bytes serial number + 16 bytes authentication number

2. **Response Buffer Allocation:**
   - Allocates bit-packed response buffer: (total_coins / 8) + 1 bytes
   - Each bit represents pass/fail status for corresponding coin
   - Initializes buffer to all zeros (fail by default)

3. **Multi-Shard Support:**
   - **CloudCoin v1 (SHARD_CLOUDCOIN):** Routes to legacy_detect function
   - **CloudCoin v2 (SHARD_SUPERCOIN):** Routes to cc2_detect function
   - **Current RAIDAX System:** Processes using main logic

4. **Main Authentication Logic:**
   - For each coin in request:
     - Extracts denomination and serial number
     - **Database Integration:** Uses get_page_by_sn_lock for on-demand page loading
     - Calculates record index within page (sn % RECORDS_PER_PAGE)
     - Compares stored 16-byte authentication number with provided value
     - Sets corresponding bit in response buffer if match found
     - Unlocks page after processing

5. **Result Classification:**
   - **STATUS_ALL_PASS:** All coins authentic
   - **STATUS_ALL_FAIL:** No coins authentic  
   - **STATUS_MIXED:** Some coins authentic, returns bit-packed results

**Performance Features:**
- **On-Demand Loading:** Pages loaded only when needed
- **Bit-Packed Response:** Efficient response format for large batches
- **Multi-Shard Compatibility:** Supports legacy and current systems

**Used By:** Client authentication operations, coin verification

**Dependencies:** Database layer, legacy coin systems, utilities

### 2. Detect Sum Command (`cmd_detect_sum`)
**Parameters:**
- Connection info structure containing request body

**Returns:** None (sets connection status)

**Purpose:** Efficiently verifies authenticity of coin batches by comparing XOR sum of authentication numbers.

**Process:**
1. **Request Validation:**
   - Validates minimum request size (39 bytes)
   - Calculates coin count from body: (body_size - 34) / 5
   - Each coin requires: 1 byte denomination + 4 bytes serial number

2. **XOR Sum Calculation:**
   - Initializes 16-byte XOR accumulator to zeros
   - For each coin:
     - Loads page using get_page_by_sn_lock
     - XORs coin's 16-byte authentication number into accumulator
     - Unlocks page immediately after use

3. **Batch Verification:**
   - Compares calculated XOR sum with provided expected sum
   - **STATUS_ALL_PASS:** XOR sums match (all coins authentic)
   - **STATUS_ALL_FAIL:** XOR sums don't match

**Performance Benefits:**
- **Reduced Network Traffic:** Single comparison instead of individual results
- **Faster Processing:** No bit-packing required for response
- **Atomic Verification:** Either entire batch passes or fails

**Used By:** Batch coin verification, high-throughput authentication

**Dependencies:** Database layer, XOR operations

### 3. Pown Command (`cmd_pown`)
**Parameters:**
- Connection info structure containing request body

**Returns:** None (sets connection status and output)

**Purpose:** Takes ownership of coins by changing their authentication numbers to new values, marking them as owned.

**Process:**
1. **Request Validation:**
   - Validates minimum request size (55 bytes)
   - Calculates coin count: (body_size - 18) / 37
   - Each coin requires: 1 byte denomination + 4 bytes SN + 16 bytes current AN + 16 bytes proposed AN

2. **MFS (Months From Start) Setup:**
   - Calculates current MFS value using get_mfs()
   - Used to timestamp coin ownership

3. **Ownership Transfer Process:**
   - For each coin:
     - Loads page and verifies current authentication number
     - If authentic:
       - Updates authentication number to proposed value
       - Sets MFS byte to current timestamp
       - Marks page as dirty for persistence
       - **Bitmap Update:** Calls update_free_pages_bitmap(den, sn, 0) to mark as not free
       - Updates statistics counters
     - Sets success bit in response buffer

4. **Result Processing:**
   - Returns bit-packed results for mixed success/failure
   - Updates POWN statistics with count and value

**Security Features:**
- **Authentication Required:** Current AN must match before ownership change
- **Atomic Updates:** Each coin ownership change is atomic
- **Audit Trail:** MFS provides timestamp of ownership change

**Used By:** Coin ownership transfer, client pown operations

**Dependencies:** Database layer, statistics system, bitmap management

### 4. Pown Sum Command (`cmd_pown_sum`)
**Parameters:**
- Connection info structure containing request body

**Returns:** None (sets connection status)

**Purpose:** Takes ownership of coin batches by applying XOR delta to authentication numbers, enabling efficient bulk ownership transfer.

**Process:**
1. **Request Validation:**
   - Validates minimum request size (55 bytes)
   - Calculates coin count: (body_size - 50) / 5
   - Request contains: coins list + 16-byte expected sum + 16-byte delta

2. **Batch Authentication:**
   - Calculates XOR sum of all coin authentication numbers
   - Compares with provided expected sum
   - Only proceeds if batch is authentic

3. **Delta Application:**
   - If authentication successful:
     - Applies 16-byte delta to each coin's authentication number using XOR
     - Updates MFS byte to current timestamp
     - Marks pages as dirty for persistence
     - **Bitmap Updates:** Updates free pages bitmap for each coin
     - Updates statistics for each coin

4. **Atomic Batch Processing:**
   - Either entire batch succeeds or fails
   - No partial updates if authentication fails

**Efficiency Benefits:**
- **Bulk Operations:** Single authentication for entire batch
- **Reduced Overhead:** XOR delta application instead of individual AN updates
- **Network Efficiency:** Smaller request size for large batches

**Used By:** Bulk ownership operations, high-throughput pown operations

**Dependencies:** Database layer, XOR operations, bitmap management, statistics
