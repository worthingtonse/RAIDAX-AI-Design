## Core Functionality

### 1. Initialize Database (`init_db`)
**Parameters:** None

   - Sets up LRU list pointers (head and tail to NULL)
   - Initializes cache statistics and mutex

2. **Page File Validation:**
   - Iterates through all denominations (MIN_DENOMINATION to MAX_DENOMINATION)
   - For each denomination, validates all page files exist
   - Creates missing page files with default coin data using random seed
   - Ensures complete file system structure integrity

3. **Background Thread Startup:**
   - Launches persistence and eviction thread
   - Thread handles periodic dirty page synchronization
   - Configures thread for continuous background operation

4. **System Readiness:**
   - Logs successful initialization
   - Database ready for concurrent page access

**Used By:** Server initialization

**Dependencies:** File system, threading system, configuration

### 2. Get Page by Serial Number with Lock (`get_page_by_sn_lock`)
**Parameters:**
- Denomination (8-bit integer)
- Serial number (32-bit integer)

**Returns:** Locked page pointer (NULL on failure)

**Purpose:** Main page access function that provides thread-safe access to coin pages through intelligent caching with automatic eviction and loading.

**Process:**
1. **Page Identification:**
   - Calculates page number from serial number (sn / RECORDS_PER_PAGE)
   - Generates cache key from denomination index and page number
   - Prepares for cache lookup operation

2. **Cache Access (Under Global Lock):**
   - Acquires cache mutex for thread-safe access
   - Performs hash table lookup for existing cached page
   - If found: moves page to front of LRU list and updates access order

3. **Cache Miss Handling:**
   - If page not in cache and cache full: identifies LRU victim for eviction
   - Removes victim from cache structures (hash table and LRU list)
   - Loads requested page from disk into memory
   - Adds new page to cache and LRU list front

4. **Critical Race Condition Fix:**
   - Releases global cache mutex BEFORE handling evicted page
   - Handles dirty page synchronization outside global lock
   - Prevents deadlock between cache mutex and page mutex

5. **Page Lock Acquisition:**
   - Locks the individual page mutex before returning
   - Ensures caller has exclusive access to page data
   - Page remains locked until caller explicitly unlocks
