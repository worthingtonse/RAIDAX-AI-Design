# On-Demand Page Cache Database Implementation (db)

## Module Purpose
This module implements a revolutionary on-demand page cache database system for efficient coin data management in the RAIDA network. It replaces the traditional approach of loading all pages into memory with an intelligent caching system that loads pages only when needed, maintains an LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy, and provides background persistence with dirty page tracking. This approach dramatically reduces memory usage while maintaining high performance.

## Core Architecture

### On-Demand Loading Philosophy
**Approach:** Load pages on-demand when accessed, cache in memory, evict when memory limit reached

**Benefits:**
- Dramatically reduced memory footprint
- Faster server startup times
- Scalable to larger datasets
- Efficient memory utilization

### Cache Management System
- **Hash Table:** Fast O(1) lookup for cached pages
- **LRU List:** Doubly-linked list for efficient cache eviction
- **Dirty Tracking:** Modified pages marked for background synchronization
- **Thread Safety:** Fine-grained locking for concurrent access

###  Denomination Enumeration

The system supports 15 distinct denominations representing different coin values:

DEN_0_00000001 = -8 (0.00000001)
DEN_0_0000001 = -7 (0.0000001)
DEN_0_000001 = -6 (0.000001)
DEN_0_00001 = -5 (0.00001)
DEN_0_0001 = -4 (0.0001)
DEN_0_001 = -3 (0.001)
DEN_0_01 = -2 (0.01)
DEN_0_1 = -1 (0.1)
DEN_1 = 0 (1)
DEN_10 = 1 (10)
DEN_100 = 2 (100)
DEN_1000 = 3 (1000)
DEN_10000 = 4 (10000)
DEN_100000 = 5 (100000)
DEN_1000000 = 6 (1000000)


- Internally, this enumeration is mapped using an offset (DENOMINATION_OFFSET = 8) to convert to array indices from 0 to 14.



### Page Object Structure

Each `page_s` object represents a cached database page and includes:

- `denomination`: signed 8-bit integer (`int8_t`)  
  Represents the coin's denomination, from -8 to +6.

- `no`: unsigned 16-bit integer (`uint16_t`)  
  Page number (0 to 65535), derived from serial number.

- `data`: byte array of size `RECORDS_PER_PAGE Ã— 17`  
  Contains coin record data (each record is 17 bytes: 16-byte AN + 1-byte MFS).

- `is_dirty`: integer boolean flag  
  Indicates whether this page has been modified and needs to be written back to disk.

- `mtx`: pthread mutex  
  Lock for synchronizing concurrent access to the page.

- `reserved_by`: unsigned 32-bit integer  
  Session ID holding the reservation; `0` means not reserved.

- `reserved_at`: time_t  
  Timestamp indicating when the reservation was made.

- `prev`, `next`: pointers to other `page_s` objects  
  Used for maintaining a doubly-linked LRU list for eviction ordering.
