# Domain Name Resolution Command Implementation (cmd_rpc.c)

## Module Purpose
This module implements a custom domain name resolution command that provides domain lookup services using local zone data files. It supports both address record (IPv4 address) and service record (service endpoint) resolution with comprehensive validation and security features.

## Core Implementation Requirements

### Domain Resolution Command Processing
- **process_domain_lookup_command(connection_data)**: Performs domain name resolution using local zone files
  - **Parameters**: Connection data structure containing domain query information
  - **Returns**: Nothing (updates connection structure with resolution result)
  - **Purpose**: Resolves domain names to network addresses or service endpoints using local zone database
  - **Implementation Requirements**:
    - Validate minimum payload size requirements (22 bytes minimum)
    - Extract record type identifier and fully qualified domain name
    - Perform domain name validation for security compliance
    - Open appropriate zone file for domain resolution
    - Parse zone file content for matching record entries
    - Return network address and port information for successful resolution
    - Handle various error conditions gracefully with appropriate error codes
  - **Input Data Format**:
    - 1 byte: Record type identifier (ADDRESS_RECORD or SERVICE_RECORD)
    - Variable: Fully qualified domain name (null-terminated string)
    - 2 bytes: Message termination marker
  - **Output Data Format**:
    - 4 bytes: IPv4 network address (32-bit value)
    - 2 bytes: Port number (16-bit value, for service records)
  - **Used by**: Client applications requiring domain name resolution services

## Record Type Support Requirements

### Address Record Resolution (ADDRESS_RECORD)
- **Purpose**: Resolves domain names to IPv4 network addresses
- **Identifier Value**: Numeric constant representing address record type
- **Processing Requirements**:
  - Search zone file for address record entries
  - Extract network address from record data field
  - Validate network address format using standard parsing
  - Return 32-bit network address in appropriate byte order

### Service Record Resolution (SERVICE_RECORD)
- **Purpose**: Resolves service names to network addresses and port numbers
- **Identifier Value**: Numeric constant representing service record type
- **Processing Requirements**:
  - Search zone file for service record entries
  - Parse network address and port from delimited format
  - Validate both network address and port number ranges
  - Return network address and port in appropriate byte order

## Domain Name Validation Requirements

### Security Validation Implementation
- **Character Validation**: Ensure domain names contain only acceptable characters
- **Allowed Characters**: Letters, digits, hyphens, and domain separators
- **Invalid Character Rejection**: Reject domains with potentially dangerous characters
- **Length Validation**: Implicit validation through buffer size constraints

### Format Validation Implementation
- **Domain Name Processing**: Handle fully qualified domain names appropriately
- **String Termination**: Ensure proper string termination for safe processing
- **Buffer Bounds**: Prevent buffer overflow through comprehensive size checking
- **Malformed Input**: Graceful handling of invalid domain name formats

## Zone File Processing Requirements

### File System Integration
- **Zone File Location**: Construct file path using configuration working directory
- **File Naming Convention**: Use standard naming format for zone files
- **Path Construction**: Build complete file path using system configuration

### Zone File Parsing Implementation
- **Line Processing**: Process zone files using line-by-line parsing
- **Comment Handling**: Ignore comment lines and whitespace-only lines
- **Whitespace Management**: Handle leading whitespace and empty line conditions

- **Dynamic Reading**: Use flexible line reading for variable file formats

### Record Format Support Requirements
- **Address Record Format**: Parse address records with network address data
- **Service Record Format**: Parse service records with address and port data
- **Field Tokenization**: Use appropriate tokenization for field extraction
- **Field Validation**: Validate record format and field content requirements

## Error Handling Requirements

### Domain Resolution Errors
- **DOMAIN_NOT_FOUND**: Domain not found (zone file doesn't exist)
- **RECORD_NOT_FOUND**: Record not found (no matching record in zone file)
- **INVALID_PARAMETER**: Invalid record type or malformed input data
- **INVALID_MESSAGE_LENGTH**: Incorrect request size or format
- **MEMORY_ALLOCATION_ERROR**: Memory allocation failure for response preparation

### File System Error Handling
- **Zone File Access**: Handle zone file open and access failures
- **Path Construction**: Manage file path construction and validation errors
- **File Reading**: Handle file reading and content parsing errors
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of file system resources

### Network Address Error Handling
- **Address Parsing**: Validate network address format and acceptable ranges
- **Port Validation**: Ensure port numbers are within valid operational range
- **Format Validation**: Handle malformed address and port data appropriately
- **Conversion Errors**: Manage address and port conversion failures

## Memory Management Requirements

### Dynamic Allocation Implementation
- **Response Buffer**: Allocate fixed-size response buffer for result data
- **Line Buffer**: Use dynamic allocation for zone file line reading operations
- **Buffer Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of dynamically allocated memory resources
- **Error Handling**: Cleanup procedures on allocation failures

### Resource Management Implementation
