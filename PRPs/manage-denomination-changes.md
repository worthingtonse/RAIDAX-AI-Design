# Change-Making Command Handlers (cmd_change)

## Module Purpose
This module implements change-making operations for denomination conversion, allowing coins to be broken into smaller denominations or joined into larger ones. It features a re-architected design with in-memory bitmap optimization that eliminates the "mega I/O read problem" and provides dual hashing support for different client encryption versions.

| `MAX_CHANGE_COINS` | 64 | Maximum number of coins handled in change operations |

## Error Codes
| Constant | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ERROR_INVALID_PACKET_LENGTH` | Request payload size is incorrect for the operation |
| `ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER` | Invalid operation type specified in request |
| `ERROR_INVALID_SN_OR_DENOMINATION` | Invalid coin serial number or denomination provided |

## Core Functionality

### 1. Get Available Change SNs (`cmd_get_available_change_sns`)
**Parameters:**
- Connection info structure containing request body

**Returns:** None (sets connection status and output)

**Purpose:** **RE-ARCHITECTED** function that instantly retrieves available serial numbers from in-memory bitmap, eliminating the slow disk-scanning problem.

**Process:**
1. **Request Validation:**
   - Validates exact request size (24 bytes)
   - Extracts session ID, operation type, and denomination
   - Validates operation type (OP_BREAK or OP_JOIN only)

2. **Target Denomination Calculation:**
   - **Break Operation:** Searches for smaller denomination (den - 1)
   - **Join Operation:** Searches for larger denomination (den + 1)
   - Validates target denomination is within valid range

3. **High-Speed Bitmap Search:**
   - **Performance Breakthrough:** Uses get_available_sns_from_bitmap function
   - **Instant Results:** No disk I/O required, all data in memory
   - **Scalable:** Can handle requests for up to MAX_CHANGE_COINS

4. **Response Construction:**
   - Returns denomination followed by available serial numbers
   - Each serial number encoded as 4-byte value
   - Response size: 1 + (count * 4) bytes

**Performance Revolution:**
- **Eliminated Mega I/O:** No longer scans thousands of page files
- **Sub-Millisecond Response:** Bitmap access provides instant results
- **Memory Efficient:** Bitmap uses minimal memory compared to full page cache
- **Scalable:** Performance independent of total coin count

**Used By:** Change-making operations, denomination conversion

**Dependencies:** In-memory bitmap system, denomination utilities

### 2. Break Command (`cmd_break`)
**Parameters:**
- Connection info structure containing request body

**Returns:** None (sets connection status)

**Purpose:** Breaks a single larger denomination coin into 10 smaller denomination coins with authentication and reservation verification.

**Process:**
1. **Request Validation:**
   - Validates exact request size (253 bytes)
   - Extracts session ID, coin to break, and 10 target coins
   - Validates denomination is within valid range (not minimum)

2. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Checks IP-based rate limiting using check_add_ipht
   - Prevents abuse of change-making operations
   - Returns rate limit error if threshold exceeded

3. **Source Coin Authentication:**
   - Loads page for coin to be broken
   - Verifies authentication number matches provided value
   - Ensures coin exists and is owned by requester

4. **Target Coin Reservation Verification:**
   - For each of 10 smaller coins:
     - Validates denomination is exactly (source_den - 1)
     - Loads page and verifies it's reserved by session ID
     - Ensures proper session-based reservation system

5. **Coin Creation Process:**
   - **Dual Hashing Support:** Chooses hash algorithm based on client encryption type
     - **Legacy (encryption_type < 4):** Uses generate_an_hash_legacy (MD5)
     - **Modern (encryption_type >= 4):** Uses generate_an_hash (SHA-256)
   - Creates 10 smaller coins with provided authentication numbers
   - Sets MFS (months from start) to current timestamp
   - Marks pages as dirty for persistence

6. **Source Coin Destruction:**
   - Generates cryptographically secure random data
   - **Dual Hashing:** Applies appropriate hash algorithm
   - Overwrites source coin with new random authentication number
   - Sets MFS to 0 (marks as free)
   - **Bitmap Update:** Updates bitmap to mark source as free

7. **Bitmap Maintenance:**
   - **Target Coins:** Marks 10 smaller coins as not free
   - **Source Coin:** Marks larger coin as free
   - Maintains perfect synchronization with coin data

**Security Features:**
- **Authentication Required:** Source coin must be authenticated
- **Session Verification:** Target coins must be properly reserved
- **Cryptographic Destruction:** Source coin cryptographically destroyed
- **Atomic Operation:** Either all succeed or operation fails

**Used By:** Denomination conversion, making change operations

**Dependencies:** Database layer, cryptographic functions, bitmap system, rate limiting

### 3. Join Command (`cmd_join`)
**Parameters:**
- Connection info structure containing request body

**Returns:** None (sets connection status)

**Purpose:** Joins 10 smaller denomination coins into a single larger denomination coin with comprehensive validation.

**Process:**
1. **Request Validation:**
   - Validates exact request size (253 bytes)
   - Extracts session ID, target larger coin, and 10 source coins
   - Validates target denomination is within valid range

2. **Target Coin Reservation Verification:**
   - Loads page for target larger coin
   - Verifies page is reserved by requesting session ID
   - Ensures proper session-based resource management

3. **Source Coin Authentication:**
   - For each of 10 smaller coins:
     - Validates denomination is exactly (target_den - 1)
     - Loads page and verifies authentication number
     - Ensures all coins are authentic before proceeding
   - **All-or-Nothing:** All 10 coins must be authentic

4. **Source Coin Destruction:**
   - For each authenticated smaller coin:
     - Sets MFS byte to 0 (marks as free)
     - Marks page as dirty for persistence
     - **Bitmap Update:** Marks coin as free in bitmap

5. **Target Coin Creation:**
   - Creates larger coin with provided authentication number
   - Sets MFS to current timestamp
   - Marks page as dirty for persistence
   - **Bitmap Update:** Marks larger coin as not free

**Transaction Safety:**
- **Pre-Validation:** All coins authenticated before any changes
- **Atomic Execution:** Either entire operation succeeds or fails
- **State Consistency:** Database and bitmap always consistent

**Used By:** Denomination consolidation, large value operations

**Dependencies:** Database layer, session management, bitmap system
