# Statistics Tracking Implementation (stats.c)

## Module Purpose
This module implements a thread-safe statistics tracking system that monitors operational metrics across the network. It provides atomic increment operations and safe data retrieval for performance monitoring, system analytics, and administrative reporting.

## Core Implementation Requirements

### Global Data Management
- **global_statistics**: System-wide statistics container instance
  - Contains all operational counters for metrics tracking
  - Must be initialized to zero on system startup
  - Protected by synchronization for thread-safe access

- **statistics_synchronization**: Global synchronization primitive for statistics access
  - Protects all statistics operations from race conditions
  - Ensures atomic updates and consistent data snapshots
  - Must be initialized during system startup

### System Initialization
- **initialize_statistics_system()**: Sets up the statistics tracking subsystem

  - **Purpose**: Initializes synchronization and resets all counters
  - **Implementation Requirements**:
    - Initialize synchronization primitive for thread safety
    - Reset all statistics counters to zero using memory initialization
    - Log initialization progress for debugging purposes

    - Release synchronization lock after update completion
    - Handle unknown field identifiers gracefully
  - **Used by**: Throughout application when tracked operations complete

### Field-Specific Update Logic
The increment function must support these operational categories:

- **ECHO_OPERATIONS_FIELD**: Updates connectivity check counter
  - Tracks basic system health and availability requests
  - Increments echo_operation_count in statistics structure

- **AUTHENTICATION_OPERATIONS_FIELD**: Updates ownership verification counter
  - Tracks item authentication and ownership verification operations
  - Increments authentication_operation_count for operation counting

- **AUTHENTICATION_VALUE_FIELD**: Updates processed value counter
  - Tracks total economic or quantitative value of processed items
  - Increments authentication_value_total for value tracking

- **TOTAL_REQUESTS_FIELD**: Updates overall request counter
  - Tracks system utilization and overall request volume
  - Increments total_request_count for load monitoring

### Statistics Retrieval
- **copy_current_statistics(destination_buffer)**: Safely copies current statistics to buffer
  - **Parameters**: Buffer to receive complete statistics structure copy
  - **Returns**: Nothing
  - **Purpose**: Provides atomic snapshot of current statistics for reporting
  - **Implementation Requirements**:
    - Acquire synchronization lock for consistent data access
    - Perform binary copy of entire statistics structure
    - Release synchronization lock after copy completion
    - Ensure snapshot consistency during concurrent updates
  - **Used by**: Monitoring systems, administrative interfaces, and reporting tools
