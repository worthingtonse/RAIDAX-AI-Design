# Healing Command Handlers (cmd_healing.c)

## Module Purpose
This module implements the healing and recovery operations for the RAIDA network, providing mechanisms to recover coins that may have been lost or corrupted due to network issues, server failures, or synchronization problems. It includes ticket-based authentication, coin discovery, and distributed consensus-based recovery operations.

## Core Functionality

### 1. Ticket Acquisition (`cmd_get_ticket`)
**Parameters:**
- Connection information structure containing request data
- Input: Variable-length payload (minimum 39 bytes) with coin authentication data

**Returns:** None (modifies connection structure with ticket information and authentication results)

**Purpose:** Verifies coin authenticity and issues a ticket for authentic coins, enabling subsequent healing operations across the RAIDA network.

**Process:**
1. **Request Validation:**
   - Validates minimum payload size (39 bytes)
   - Calculates coin count from payload size (21 bytes per coin record)
   - Validates coin data alignment and format

2. **Coin Authentication:**
   - For each coin in the request:
     - Extracts denomination, serial number, and authentication number
     - Retrieves coin page using on-demand cache system
     - Compares provided authentication number with stored value
     - Tracks authentic versus failed coins

3. **Ticket Allocation:**
   - Allocates free ticket slot from ticket memory pool
   - Stores authenticated coins in ticket structure
   - Generates unique ticket identifier
   - Initializes claim tracking for all RAIDA servers

4. **Response Generation:**
   - Creates bitmap indicating coin authentication results
   - Includes ticket identifier for successful operations
   - Provides status based on authentication results:
     - **STATUS_ALL_PASS:** All coins authentic, ticket issued
     - **STATUS_ALL_FAIL:** No coins authentic, no ticket
     - **STATUS_MIXED:** Partial success, ticket issued with bitmap

**Security Features:**
- Authentication number verification before ticket issuance
