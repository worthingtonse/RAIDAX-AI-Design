# Network Address Rate Limiting Interface (ht.h)

## Module Purpose
This interface defines a network address-based rate limiting system that prevents abuse by tracking client request frequencies. The system uses efficient indexing to monitor and limit requests from individual network addresses over configurable time periods.

## Core Data Structures

### Rate Limiting Entry
- **RateLimitEntry**: Structure representing request tracking for a network address
  - **request_count**: Counter tracking requests within current time window
  - **last_seen_time**: Timestamp of most recent request from this address
  - **Purpose**: Maintains per-address request history for rate limiting decisions

## System Configuration Constants

### Storage Configuration
- **RATE_LIMIT_TABLE_SIZE**: Size of the address tracking table
  - Provides address space distribution for efficient lookup
  - Balances memory usage with collision probability
  - Recommended value: 65536 entries for 16-bit address space

### Rate Limiting Parameters
- **RATE_LIMIT_TIME_WINDOW**: Duration for request counting in time units
  - Defines the rolling window for request accumulation
  - Expired entries automatically reset when this period elapses
  - Recommended value: 28800 time units (8 hours in seconds)

- **MAXIMUM_REQUESTS_PER_WINDOW**: Threshold for blocking additional requests
  - Maximum allowed requests per time window from single address
  - Prevents abuse while allowing legitimate high-frequency usage
  - Recommended value: 30 requests per window

## Function Interfaces

### System Management
- **initialize_rate_limiting()**: Sets up the network address rate limiting system
  - **Parameters**: None
  - **Returns**: Success indicator (true/false or status code)
  - **Purpose**: Initializes tracking table with clean state
  - **Called by**: Application startup sequence

### Rate Limiting Operations
- **check_and_update_rate_limit(network_address)**: Validates and updates rate limiting for an address
  - **Parameters**: String representation of client network address
  - **Returns**: Permission indicator (allowed/denied or status code)
  - **Purpose**: Determines if request should be permitted based on address history
  - **Implementation Logic**:
    - Parse network address from string format
    - Calculate index for address tracking table
    - Check if current request count exceeds configured limits
    - Update request count and timestamp if request is allowed
    - Return denial status if rate limit has been exceeded
  - **Used by**: Request processing pipeline before operation execution

## Rate Limiting Logic Requirements
- **Time Window Expiration**: Entries older than RATE_LIMIT_TIME_WINDOW automatically reset
- **Request Counting**: Each permitted request increments the address counter
- **Threshold Enforcement**: Requests exceeding MAXIMUM_REQUESTS_PER_WINDOW are denied
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expired entries cleaned up during normal operation

## Address Table Design
- **Address Indexing**: Use address characteristics for efficient table lookup
- **Direct Access**: Provide constant-time access for rate limit checking
- **Memory Efficiency**: Fixed-size table with predictable memory usage
- **Fast Operations**: Optimize for minimal overhead during request processing

## Special Address Handling
- **Local Address Exemption**: Loopback and local addresses bypass rate limiting
- **Trusted Networks**: Capability for exempting specific address ranges
- **Address Validation**: Proper network address parsing and validation

## Integration Requirements
- **Used by**: Request processing pipeline for abuse prevention
- **Depends on**: 
  - Standard address parsing capabilities
  - Time management functions for timestamp handling
  - Logging system for rate limit violation reporting
- **Provides**: Abuse protection for all network-facing services

## Performance Requirements
- **Fast Lookup**: Address table provides constant-time rate limit checking
- **Memory Efficient**: Fixed memory footprint regardless of active address count
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Time-based expiration prevents memory bloat
- **Minimal Overhead**: Simple operations with timestamp checking

## Security Features
- **Abuse Prevention**: Protects against denial-of-service attacks and resource exhaustion
- **Configurable Limits**: Adjustable thresholds for different security requirements
- **Transparent Operation**: Rate limiting operates without affecting legitimate users
- **Monitoring Integration**: Rate limit violations can be logged for analysis

## Configuration Dependencies
- **Address Parsing**: Network address string parsing and conversion capabilities
- **Time Functions**: Timestamp management and comparison functionality
- **Logging Interface**: Debug and error reporting for rate limit events

## Design Requirements
- **Address Distribution**: Rely on address characteristics for optimal performance
- **Time Resolution**: Appropriate precision for rate limiting decisions
- **Memory Trade-off**: Fixed memory usage versus dynamic allocation strategies
- **Simplicity**: Straightforward implementation for reliable operation and maintenance
