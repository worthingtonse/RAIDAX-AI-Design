# System Communication Interface (common.h)

## Module Purpose
This interface defines communication protocols for interacting with digital asset systems. It provides socket communication, packet construction, and asset verification functions for backward compatibility with second-generation asset systems.

## Communication Configuration

### Socket Connection Parameters
- **SOCKET_PATH**: File system path for inter-process communication
  - Defines location of communication endpoint for system
  - Used for establishing connection to external asset processing service
  - Default configuration points to system socket location

## Function Interfaces

### Connection Management
- **initialize__socket_connection()**: Establishes communication channel with the system
  - **Parameters**: None
  - **Returns**: Connection handle or error indicator
  - **Purpose**: Creates and configures socket connection for the system communication
  - **Implementation Requirements**:
    - Create inter-process communication socket
    - Configure connection timeouts for reliable operation
    - Establish connection to system endpoint
    - Handle connection failures gracefully
  - **Used by**:  asset verification and processing operations

### Packet Construction
- **allocate__packet(payload_length)**: Creates properly formatted communication packet
  - **Parameters**: Length of payload data to be transmitted

### Asset Verification Operations
- **verify__assets(asset_data, asset_count, passed_count, failed_count, result_bitmap)**: Verifies assets using the system
  - **Parameters**:
    - Asset data buffer containing verification information
    - Total number of assets to verify
    - Output parameter for count of verified assets
    - Output parameter for count of failed verifications
    - Output buffer for detailed verification results
  - **Returns**: Operation status code
  - **Purpose**: Performs asset authenticity verification through  system
  - **Implementation Requirements**:
    - Construct verification packet with asset data
    - Transmit packet to  system
    - Receive and parse verification response
    - Handle different response types (all pass, all fail, mixed results)
    - Extract bitmap results for mixed verification outcomes
  - **Used by**: Asset authentication processing for compatibility

### Asset Deletion Operations  
- **delete__assets(authentication_data, serial_number_data, asset_count)**: Removes assets from system
  - **Parameters**:
    - Authentication data for asset ownership proof
    - Serial number data identifying assets to delete
    - Number of assets to process
  - **Returns**: Operation status code
  - **Purpose**: Performs asset deletion operations in system
  - **Implementation Requirements**:
    - Construct deletion packet with authentication proof
    - Include serial numbers for assets to be deleted
    - Transmit deletion request to system
    - Process deletion response and status codes
    - Handle partial deletion scenarios appropriately
  - **Used by**: Asset cleanup and ownership transfer operations

## Protocol Requirements

### Packet Structure
- **Header Fields**: System identification, command codes, packet length
- **Payload Section**: Asset data formatted according to protocol
- **Checksum Fields**: Data integrity verification for reliable transmission
- **Termination Markers**: Protocol frame boundaries for proper parsing

### Communication Protocol
- **Request-Response Pattern**: Synchronous communication with system
- **Timeout Handling**: Configurable timeouts for network reliability
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of communication failures
- **Status Codes**: Standardized response codes for operation results

## Integration Requirements
- **Used by**: asset verification and processing modules
- **Depends on**: 
  - Socket communication capabilities for inter-process communication
  - Memory management for packet allocation and cleanup
  - Error handling and logging for troubleshooting
  - Configuration system for socket path and system settings
- **Provides**: Complete interface for system compatibility

## Security Considerations
- **Authentication Proof**: All operations require proper authentication data
- **Data Integrity**: Checksum verification ensures packet integrity
